# Auth-React-Mui

This project involves creating login and sign-up pages in a React application with Material-UI and Redux. The sign-up pages require a valid email, secure password, and password confirmation. Validation includes checking the email format and password security. In the login page, users provide credentials corresponding to their signup. The aim is to build a robust and secure authentication system.
